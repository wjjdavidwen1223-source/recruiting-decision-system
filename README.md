# 🚀 Machine Learning-Based Resume Ranking System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Python-based system that evaluates candidate-job fit by transforming unstructured resume data into a structured scoring framework.

It models candidate evaluation as a ranking and decision-making problem, enabling consistent, data-driven comparison across multiple candidates.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Feature engineering from unstructured data  
- Rule-based scoring as a baseline model  
- Candidate ranking and classification  
- Handling real-world data variability  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Processes and structures candidate data using Pandas  
- Matches candidate skills against job requirements  
- Computes scores based on skill alignment and experience  
- Ranks candidates from strongest to weakest fit  
- Produces standardized outputs for consistent evaluation  

---

## 🧮 Scoring Model
- +2 points per matching required skill  
- +1 point per year of relevant experience  

---

## 📊 Example Output

| Name  | Score | Decision          |
|------|------|------------------|
| Cathy | 11   | Strong Fit        |
| Alex  | 9    | Good Fit          |
| Brian | 6    | Needs Improvement |

## 🧪 Real-World Validation
- Evaluated system using 20+ real candidate profiles  
- Tested across 50+ simulated scenarios  
- Identified edge cases such as:
  - Strong candidates under-ranked due to missing keywords  
  - Inconsistent resume formatting affecting evaluation  
- Refined scoring logic to improve consistency and robustness  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas

## ▶️ How to Run
pip install pandas  
python resume_scoring.py  

---

## 💡 Example Use Case
Given a dataset of candidates and job requirements, the system:
1. Extracts structured features  
2. Computes candidate scores  
3. Ranks candidates  
4. Outputs standardized decisions  

---

## 📈 Impact
- Standardizes candidate evaluation  
- Reduces subjective bias in screening  
- Improves efficiency in comparing candidates  
- Simulates real-world decision workflows  

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Add supervised ML model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Improve feature engineering  
- Integrate NLP for resume parsing  
- Expand dataset for better evaluation  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Translating real-world workflows into data-driven systems  
- Structured decision-making using Python  
- Foundations for machine learning-based ranking systems  

---

## Demo
See `resume_scoring.py` for a sample implementation and output.

## 🤖 ML Extension
This project was extended with a baseline supervised machine learning model using Logistic Regression.

The workflow includes:
- preprocessing structured candidate features
- one-hot encoding categorical variables
- splitting data into training and test sets
- training a classification model to predict candidate fit
- evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

This extension demonstrates the transition from rule-based candidate scoring to a data-driven ML approach.
